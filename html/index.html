          This daily baking ritual and special time together in the kitchen left
          a lasting impression. When Susie grew up to become Susan and moved to
          the West Coast, she brought along her grandmothers’ carefully recorded
          recipes on handwritten 3×5 cards.<br />

          The pure and simple connection those recipes fostered helped Susan
          form SusieCakes bakeries to share her experience with others
